ZAND Symbiotic variables of the Z Andromedae type. They are close
binaries consisting of a hot star, a star of late type, and an
extended envelope excited by the hot star's radiation. The combined
brightness displays irregular variations with amplitudes up to 4
mag. in V. A very inhomogeneous group of objects.
